### AWS Technology Introduction

AWS is great, sometimes. It lowers the barrier for us to do really dumb things really quickly.

AWS has a few key intro level concepts:
- Account
    - think of this like your LAN ID - it's an account. It's also one of the entities useful for billing.
- Service
    - AWS is a collection of many many services. These are technologies which Amazon has deployed for our use.
    - Common services are Elastic Compute Cloud (aka EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and Redshift


#### Services for today:
